Battray is a nice program that provides a tray icon to inform you of the
battery status of your notebook.  It is simple, easy to use and configure,
fairly environment-independent (http://code.google.com/p/battray/).

However, it wants to do some nasty things like coloring the battery image
and does not respect custom datadir well (as it should); it also terminates
status messages with a dot (full stop) which I do not like.  Here you can
find my config and a patch I use when building FreeBSD port thereof.

P.S.  Battery state icons I refer in config file are taken from libre icon
pack (quite awesome) "Fugue Icons" from Japanese artist Yusuke Kamiyamane,
his website: http://p.yusukekamiyamane.com/.
